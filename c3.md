### Chapter 3: Process Management

#### 3.1 Process Concepts
- **Process**: A program in execution, which includes the program code, its current activity, and associated resources.
- **Components of a Process**:
  - **Program Code**: Also known as the text section.
  - **Program Counter**: Indicates the address of the next instruction.
  - **Stack**: Contains temporary data such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables.
  - **Heap**: Dynamically allocated memory during runtime.
  - **Data Section**: Contains global variables.

#### 3.2 Process States
- **New**: The process is being created.
- **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.
- **Running**: Instructions are being executed.
- **Waiting**: The process is waiting for some event (e.g., I/O completion).
- **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.

#### 3.3 Process Control Block (PCB)
- **Definition**: A data structure used by the OS to store all information about a process.
- **Contents**:
  - **Process State**: Current state of the process (e.g., running, waiting).
  - **Program Counter**: Address of the next instruction.
  - **CPU Registers**: Contents of all process registers.
  - **Memory Management Information**: Page tables, segment tables, etc.
  - **Accounting Information**: CPU usage, real-time used, etc.
  - **I/O Status Information**: List of I/O devices allocated to the process, list of open files.

#### 3.4 Process Scheduling
- **Scheduling Queues**:
  - **Job Queue**: Set of all processes in the system.
  - **Ready Queue**: Set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute.
  - **Device Queues**: Set of processes waiting for a particular I/O device.
- **Schedulers**:
  - **Long-Term Scheduler** (Job Scheduler): Selects processes from the job queue and loads them into memory.
  - **Short-Term Scheduler** (CPU Scheduler): Selects processes from the ready queue and allocates the CPU.
  - **Medium-Term Scheduler**: Swaps processes in and out of memory to balance the load.

#### 3.5 Context Switching
- **Definition**: The process of storing the state of a currently running process and loading the state of the next process to run.
- **Steps**:
  1. Save the state of the current process in its PCB.
  2. Load the state of the next process from its PCB.
- **Overhead**: Context switching is time-consuming and involves overhead since the system does no useful work while switching.

#### 3.6 Operations on Processes
- **Process Creation**:
  - **Parent Process**: The process that creates another process.
  - **Child Process**: The new process created by the parent.
  - **System Calls**: Examples include `fork()` in Unix/Linux and `CreateProcess()` in Windows.
  - **Process Hierarchy**: Processes are organized in a tree, with the initial process being the root.
- **Process Termination**:
  - **Exit System Call**: Process completes execution and releases resources.
  - **Abort**: Parent process may terminate a child process using an abort system call.
  - **Reasons for Termination**: Normal completion, errors, parent request, resource unavailability.

#### 3.7 Interprocess Communication (IPC)
- **Definition**: Mechanism that allows processes to communicate and synchronize their actions.
- **Methods**:
  - **Shared Memory**: Processes share a region of memory.
  - **Message Passing**: Processes communicate by sending and receiving messages.
- **Direct vs. Indirect Communication**:
  - **Direct**: Processes must name each other explicitly.
  - **Indirect**: Messages are sent to and received from mailboxes or ports.

#### 3.8 Multithreading Models
- **Multithreading**: The ability of a CPU to execute multiple threads concurrently.
- **Benefits**: Improved responsiveness, resource sharing, economy, scalability.
- **Models**:
  - **Many-to-One**: Many user-level threads mapped to a single kernel thread.
  - **One-to-One**: Each user-level thread maps to a kernel thread.
  - **Many-to-Many**: Many user-level threads mapped to many kernel threads.

#### 3.9 Concurrency Issues
- **Race Conditions**: Two or more threads access shared data simultaneously and the final result depends on the timing of their execution.
- **Critical Section**: Part of the code where shared resources are accessed.
- **Requirements for Solving Critical-Section Problems**:
  - **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can execute in the critical section at a time.
  - **Progress**: If no process is in the critical section, and some processes wish to enter, one of the waiting processes must be allowed to enter.
  - **Bounded Waiting**: A bound must exist on the number of times other processes are allowed to enter the critical section after a process has requested to enter.

#### 3.10 Synchronization Tools and Techniques
- **Mutex Locks**: Provides mutual exclusion by locking a critical section.
- **Semaphores**:
  - **Binary Semaphore**: Similar to mutex but with an integer value (0 or 1).
  - **Counting Semaphore**: Allows resource counting and access control.
- **Monitors**: High-level synchronization construct that provides a mechanism to achieve mutual exclusion.
- **Condition Variables**: Used within monitors to allow processes to wait for certain conditions to be true.

### Chapter 5: CPU Scheduling

#### 5.1 Basic Concepts
- **CPU Scheduling**: The process of determining which processes in the ready queue are to be allocated the CPU.
- **Scheduling Criteria**: Goals that help evaluate the performance of scheduling algorithms.
  - **CPU Utilization**: Keeping the CPU as busy as possible.
  - **Throughput**: Number of processes completed per time unit.
  - **Turnaround Time**: Total time taken from submission of a process to its completion.
  - **Waiting Time**: Total time a process spends in the ready queue waiting for CPU.
  - **Response Time**: Time from submission of a request until the first response is produced.

#### 5.2 Scheduling Algorithms
- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**:
  - **Description**: Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
  - **Advantages**: Simple and easy to implement.
  - **Disadvantages**: Can lead to the "convoy effect" where short processes wait for a long process to finish.

- **Shortest Job Next (SJN) / Shortest Job First (SJF)**:
  - **Description**: Processes with the shortest burst time are scheduled first.
  - **Advantages**: Minimizes average waiting time.
  - **Disadvantages**: Difficult to predict burst time; may cause starvation of long processes.

- **Priority Scheduling**:
  - **Description**: Processes are scheduled based on priority.
  - **Advantages**: Flexible, can incorporate various priority schemes.
  - **Disadvantages**: Can cause starvation; requires priority inversion handling.

- **Round Robin (RR)**:
  - **Description**: Each process gets a small unit of CPU time (time quantum), and processes are cycled through.
  - **Advantages**: Fair, each process gets an equal share of the CPU.
  - **Disadvantages**: Can lead to high turnaround time if the time quantum is too small.

- **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**:
  - **Description**: Processes are divided into different queues based on priority, each with its own scheduling algorithm.
  - **Advantages**: Can tailor different scheduling needs for different types of processes.
  - **Disadvantages**: Complex to implement and manage.

- **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**:
  - **Description**: Allows processes to move between queues based on their behavior and CPU bursts.
  - **Advantages**: Dynamic, adapts to process behavior, reduces starvation.
  - **Disadvantages**: Complex implementation and tuning of parameters.

#### 5.3 Thread Scheduling
- **Kernel-Level Thread Scheduling**: The kernel schedules threads in a similar way to process scheduling.
- **User-Level Thread Scheduling**: User-level threads are managed by a user-level thread library and the kernel is unaware of them.
- **Contention Scope**:
  - **Process-Contention Scope (PCS)**: Competition among threads within the same process.
  - **System-Contention Scope (SCS)**: Competition among all threads in the system.

#### 5.4 Multiple-Processor Scheduling
- **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP)**: Only one processor accesses the system data structures, reducing the need for data sharing.
- **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP)**: Each processor is self-scheduling; all processes are in a common ready queue, or each processor has its own private queue.
- **Processor Affinity**: Binding a process to a specific processor to increase performance due to cache reuse.
  - **Soft Affinity**: Preference but not strict binding to a specific processor.
  - **Hard Affinity**: Strict binding to a specific processor.
- **Load Balancing**: Ensuring that all processors are equally loaded to avoid some being idle while others are overloaded.

#### 5.5 Real-Time CPU Scheduling
- **Real-Time Systems**: Systems that require a specific set of constraints to be met for process execution.
- **Types**:
  - **Hard Real-Time Systems**: Strict constraints must be met (e.g., flight control systems).
  - **Soft Real-Time Systems**: Performance is critical but not absolutely required (e.g., multimedia systems).
- **Real-Time Scheduling Algorithms**:
  - **Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**: Assigns priorities based on the frequency of occurrence of tasks.
  - **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**: Dynamically assigns priority based on how close the deadline is.

#### 5.6 Algorithm Evaluation
- **Deterministic Modeling**: Uses a predetermined workload and evaluates performance.
- **Queueing Models**: Use probabilistic distribution to model process arrivals and CPU burst times.
- **Simulations**: Create a model of the system and simulate process behavior to evaluate performance.
- **Implementation**: Implementing algorithms in real systems to observe performance under actual operating conditions.

#### 5.7 Choosing a Scheduling Algorithm
- **Workload Characteristics**: The choice of scheduling algorithm depends on the type of workload, such as CPU-bound or I/O-bound processes.
- **Performance Metrics**: Different algorithms perform better based on different criteria like throughput, turnaround time, or response time.
- **System Goals**: The overall goals of the system, whether it prioritizes fairness, efficiency, or real-time constraints.

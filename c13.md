### Chapter 13: Distributed Systems

#### 13.1 Introduction to Distributed Systems
- **Distributed Systems**: A model where components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages.
- **Characteristics**:
  - **Scalability**: Ability to handle increasing amounts of work by adding resources.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Capability to continue operation despite failures.
  - **Concurrency**: Multiple processes running simultaneously.
  - **Transparency**: Hides the complexity of the distributed environment from users.

#### 13.2 Architecture of Distributed Systems
- **Client-Server Model**:
  - **Client**: Requests services or resources from the server.
  - **Server**: Provides services or resources in response to client requests.
  
- **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Model**:
  - **Peers**: Nodes that act both as clients and servers, sharing resources and services directly with each other.

- **Multi-tier Architecture**:
  - **Presentation Tier**: User interface layer.
  - **Application Tier**: Business logic layer.
  - **Data Tier**: Data storage and management layer.

#### 13.3 Communication in Distributed Systems
- **Communication Protocols**:
  - **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)**: Allows a program to execute a procedure on a remote server as if it were local.
  - **Message Passing**: Direct exchange of messages between processes or nodes (e.g., MPI - Message Passing Interface).

- **Communication Models**:
  - **Synchronous Communication**: Sender and receiver must be active at the same time.
  - **Asynchronous Communication**: Sender and receiver do not need to be active simultaneously.

- **Serialization**:
  - **Definition**: Converting data structures or objects into a format that can be easily transmitted over a network and reconstructed.
  - **Techniques**: JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers.

#### 13.4 Coordination and Synchronization
- **Coordination**: Managing interactions between distributed components to achieve a common goal.
- **Synchronization**: Ensuring that distributed components operate in a coordinated manner.
  
- **Algorithms**:
  - **Lamport's Logical Clocks**: Provides a way to order events in a distributed system.
  - **Vector Clocks**: Extends Lamport's clocks to track causality more precisely.
  - **Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC)**: Ensures all participants in a distributed transaction agree to commit or abort the transaction.

- **Consensus Algorithms**:
  - **Paxos**: Provides a way to achieve consensus in a network of unreliable processors.
  - **Raft**: An alternative to Paxos that is more understandable and easier to implement.

#### 13.5 Fault Tolerance and Recovery
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ability of a system to continue operation despite hardware or software failures.
  
- **Redundancy**:
  - **Replication**: Duplicating data or services across multiple nodes to ensure availability.
  - **Checkpointing**: Saving the state of a process at regular intervals to recover from failures.

- **Recovery Techniques**:
  - **Failover**: Switching to a backup system or component when a failure is detected.
  - **Rollback**: Reverting to a previous state after a failure or error.

#### 13.6 Security in Distributed Systems
- **Security Challenges**:
  - **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that data is not altered or tampered with during transmission.
  - **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users and systems.
  - **Authorization**: Ensuring that users and systems have appropriate access rights.

- **Security Mechanisms**:
  - **Encryption**: Protecting data during transmission using cryptographic techniques.
  - **Access Control**: Implementing policies and mechanisms to restrict access to resources.

#### 13.7 Distributed File Systems
- **Definition**: Systems that manage files across multiple machines, providing a single file system view.
  
- **Examples**:
  - **Network File System (NFS)**: Allows files to be shared across a network.
  - **Google File System (GFS)**: Designed for large-scale data processing applications.

- **Challenges**:
  - **Consistency**: Ensuring that all nodes have a consistent view of the file system.
  - **Availability**: Ensuring that the file system is accessible even in the presence of failures.

#### 13.8 Cloud Computing
- **Definition**: A model for delivering computing services over the internet, including storage, processing power, and applications.
  
- **Service Models**:
  - **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., AWS EC2).
  - **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications (e.g., Google App Engine).
  - **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., Microsoft Office 365).

- **Benefits**:
  - **Scalability**: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
  - **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go pricing models reduce capital expenses.
  - **Accessibility**: Access services and resources from anywhere with an internet connection.

#### 13.9 Emerging Trends in Distributed Systems
- **Edge Computing**: Extends computing resources to the edge of the network, closer to where data is generated, to reduce latency and improve performance.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decomposes applications into smaller, independent services that communicate over a network, allowing for more flexibility and scalability.
- **Serverless Computing**: Abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on code execution without managing servers.

### Chapter 7: File Systems

#### 7.1 File System Overview
- **File System**: The method and data structures used by an OS to manage files on storage devices.
- **File**: A named collection of related data or instructions that are stored on a storage device.
- **File Operations**:
  - **Creation**: Making a new file.
  - **Deletion**: Removing a file.
  - **Reading**: Accessing data from a file.
  - **Writing**: Modifying data in a file.
  - **Appends**: Adding data to the end of a file.

#### 7.2 File Attributes
- **Name**: Identifier for the file.
- **Type**: File type (e.g., text, binary).
- **Location**: Pointer to the file's data blocks on the storage device.
- **Size**: Amount of space the file occupies.
- **Permissions**: Access control (e.g., read, write, execute).
- **Timestamp**: Metadata indicating creation, modification, and access times.

#### 7.3 File Structure
- **File Organization**: The way data is arranged within a file.
  - **Sequential**: Data is accessed in a linear order.
  - **Direct/Random**: Data is accessed based on an index or key.
- **File Allocation Methods**:
  - **Contiguous Allocation**: Allocates a contiguous block of space for a file.
    - **Advantages**: Simple and efficient for sequential access.
    - **Disadvantages**: Leads to fragmentation.
  - **Linked Allocation**: Uses pointers to link blocks of a file.
    - **Advantages**: Eliminates fragmentation.
    - **Disadvantages**: Slower access times due to pointer traversal.
  - **Indexed Allocation**: Uses an index block that contains pointers to the file's data blocks.
    - **Advantages**: Efficient access and flexible file sizes.
    - **Disadvantages**: Index block can become large.

#### 7.4 Directory Structure
- **Directory**: A file that contains a list of files and subdirectories.
- **Directory Operations**:
  - **Creation**: Making a new directory.
  - **Deletion**: Removing a directory.
  - **Renaming**: Changing the directory's name.
  - **Traversal**: Navigating through directories.
- **Directory Implementation**:
  - **Single-Level Directory**: All files are in one directory.
  - **Two-Level Directory**: Separate directories for each user or group.
  - **Hierarchical Directory**: Nested directories allowing for a tree-like structure.
- **Directory Entries**: Contain file names and pointers to file attributes.

#### 7.5 File System Implementation
- **File Control Block (FCB)**: Data structure used to store information about a file.
  - **Components**:
    - **File Attributes**: Metadata about the file.
    - **File Location**: Addresses of the file's data blocks.
    - **File Size**: Total size of the file.
- **Inode (Index Node)**: Data structure used in UNIX-like systems to represent a file.
  - **Components**:
    - **File Metadata**: Permissions, ownership, timestamps.
    - **File Data Block Pointers**: Addresses of file data blocks.
- **Free Space Management**:
  - **Bit Vector**: Uses a bitmap to keep track of free and allocated blocks.
  - **Linked List**: Maintains a list of free blocks.
  - **Grouping**: Keeps track of free blocks in groups for efficient allocation.

#### 7.6 File System Mounting
- **Mounting**: The process of making a file system accessible to the OS by attaching it to a directory.
- **Mount Point**: The directory where the file system is attached.
- **Unmounting**: The process of detaching a file system, making it inaccessible.

#### 7.7 File System Security and Protection
- **Access Control**: Mechanisms to control who can access or modify files.
  - **File Permissions**: Read, write, and execute permissions for users and groups.
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**: Detailed permissions for individual users or groups.
- **Encryption**: Protects file contents from unauthorized access by converting data into an unreadable format.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Creating copies of files and directories to protect against data loss.

#### 7.8 File System Performance
- **Caching**: Storing frequently accessed data in memory to reduce access times.
- **Buffering**: Using temporary storage to accumulate data before writing it to the disk.
- **File System Tuning**: Adjusting parameters and settings to optimize performance, such as block size and allocation policies.

#### 7.9 Advanced File Systems
- **Journaling File Systems**: Maintain a log (journal) of changes to prevent data corruption in case of crashes (e.g., ext3, ext4).
- **Log-Structured File Systems**: Write all changes to a log to improve performance and recovery (e.g., LogFS).
- **Distributed File Systems**: Manage files across multiple networked computers (e.g., NFS, HDFS).
